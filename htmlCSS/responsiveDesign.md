# Responsive Design

## Practices
- Flexible grids
- Fluid images - set max width to scale based on screen size
- Media queries - get display size, orientation, and aspect ratio from the browser 

## Breakpoint
- When the websites content and layout will adapt to a new screen size
- Fixed grid - Fixed grid widths with flexible margins
- Fluid grid - Columns grow or shrink to adapt to the available space.
- Hybrid grids - use a combination of the above

## Bootstrap
- Infixes - Generates breakpoints based on screen width: xs (default), sm, md, lg, xl, and xxl class infixes
- Modifiers - Changes the color of an object: primary, secondary, success, info, warning, danger, light, dark
- Grid - 12 column system, 
- Container - contains pads and aligns your contents with width determined by your breakpoint.
