# Dieter Rams' 10 Principles of Good Design

## 1. Good design is innovative  
Whether you are making a change or doing something in a new way, developing new ideas or making improvements to existing designs and working alongside new technology, all of these offer a multitude of opportunities for you to be innovative within a design.

## 2. Good design makes a product useful  
It doesn't matter how stunning a product looks if it is practically unusable, as it becomes completely worthless. Products are not pieces of art to be admired. They are there to serve a purpose and solve a problem.

## 3. Good design is aesthetic  
Beautiful items tend to make us feel comfortable. If a product is beautiful, you may be more inclined to use and want it. Some may argue against this point as beauty is subjective, and some well-designed items prioritize utility over beauty. Regardless of taste, people generally prefer the things around them to be beautiful.

## 4. Good design makes a product understandable  
For example, handles on doors that don't indicate if they should be pushed or pulled or taps that don't indicate if they are hot or cold leave users confused. The best products are self-explanatory and communicate their purpose and how to use them, saving users from breaking the product or reading through lengthy manuals.

## 5. Good design is unobtrusive  
An over-designed product becomes obtrusive. Products that succeed allow users to do exactly what they need to do without hindrance. These designs help users complete tasks effectively and comfortably, without forcing them into awkward processes or assumptions about how they should act.

## 6. Good design is honest  
Honest design doesn't include tricks or pretend to be something it isn't. It avoids making false promises to manipulate users. The best designs prioritize the user's interests without trying to deceive or exaggerate.

## 7. Good design is long-lasting  
Great design avoids trends that make it appear outdated. It is carefully crafted to remain relevant and functional over time, focusing on durability and timeless appeal.

## 8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail  
Good design is detail-oriented and leaves nothing to chance. Every aspect of the product must be considered carefully, ensuring that all elements contribute to the overall purpose. Products should reflect care and thoughtfulness in their creation.

## 9. Good design is environmentally friendly  
Design should minimize pollution by avoiding wasted resources throughout a productâ€™s lifecycle. Both physical and digital resources should be used responsibly to reduce environmental impact.

## 10. Good design is as little as possible  
Design should be intentional, excluding anything that doesn't serve a purpose. Less clutter leads to more clarity, making the product easier for users to engage with and understand.
