# Planning and Logic

## Principles
Core Components
- Servers
- Databases
- APIs

Principles
- Data Integrity & Security
- Performance Optimization
- Scalability

Error Handling & Reliability

## Project Planning
- Define requirements - What, for who, and why
- Setting objectives - SMART (see below)
- Creating timelines
- Idenfifying resources - right tools, technology and team members
- Scope - what is defined by the project and what it not

## Workflow
- Planning
- Architecture Design
- Development 
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

## SMART Goals
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound
- ex. Develop and implement enhansed search functionality that reduces search time by 50% within the next six months

## Problem Solving
Logical Processes
- Sequence - the order the code is executed
- Control Structure or Conditional Statements - paths for code to follow
- Iterations - looping through a block of code
- Logical operators - boolean - AND, OR, and NOT

Deductive Reasoning
- A logical process by which conclusion are drawn from given premises
- Arguments: Premises, conclusion, supporting relation
- Process:
1. Identify the premises - statements that you believe are true - should be clear, factual, and directly related to the problem you are trying to solve.
2. Analyze the premises - analyze premises to see how they relate
3. Draw a conclusion - find a direct cause-effect relationshp to identify the cause of a problem based on logic
4. Test the conclusion - test your conclusion to veryify it is correct.

```
Task: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 100 is a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.
Psuedocode:
Start
Input year 
If year is divisible by 4
  Or if year is divisible by 400
    Display to user "Leap year"
  Otherwise print “Not a leap year”
End
```
