# AI Services and Solutions
- Deep Learning - a system that's modeled on the neural network of the human mind, enabling it to discover, learn, and grow through experience.
- Machine Learning - a sata science technique th at uses existing data to train a model, test it, and then apply the model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. 

## Azure Machine Learning
- consists of tools and services that allow you to connect to data, to train and test models, to find one that would most accurately predict a future result
- Provides complete control over the design and training of an algorithm used on your data
- Build => Deliver => Train => Evaluate => Create => Deploy
- used to predict future outcomes based on private historical data

## Azure Cognitive Services
- provide pre-built machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason.
- used to solve general problems - Language, Speech, Vision, Decision, Translation and analysis
- Azure Cognitive Services Personalizer - identifies usage patterns, predict behavior
- 

## Azure Bot Service and Bot Framework
- create virtual agents that understand and reply to questions
- used to interact with humans 
- has pre-build no code solutions to common scenarios
- Q&A maker - is fed FAQ, support pages, manuals, documents, etc to offer support for products
- Power Virtual Agents - can use hundreds of prebuilt connectors for data input to provide a way for users to connect their accounts and leverage a set of prebuilt actions and triggers to build their apps and workflows
