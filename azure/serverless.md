# Azure Serverless options
- Azure Logic Apps 
    - design-first approach for developers (custom connectors like a database)
    - use to automate, orchestrate, and integrate disparate components of a distributed application
- Microsoft Power Automate 
    - design-first approach for non-developers
    - use to create workflows when you have no development experience
- Azure App Service WebJobs 
    - code-first approach
    - integrates with App Service or Job Host
    - Pay for a VM or App Service Plan
- Azure Functions 
    - code-first approach
    - Pay only when the function runs
    - easier integration with Logic Apps
    - event-driven, stateless or stateful using storage service
    - timeouts - http request @ 2.5 min, else 5-10 min max.  Can use durable functions without timeouts
    - calling frequency - one per 10 seconds 

## Azure Functions Triggers
- Timer - needs a init timestamp and a CRON
    - CRON Expression - syntax for setting time triggers
- HTTP - when an HTTP request is received
    - Customized triggers - API keys for access, HTTP Verb restrictions, query string params, routing templates
    - Authorization Levels - Anonymous (no API key), and Function, Admin (API key required)
    - Authorization Keys - function key (specific to a function) or host keys (access to all functions - required for Admin Auth Level)
- Blob - when a file is uploaded or updated in Azure Blob Storage
    - Blob Types
        - Block blobs - stores binary or text
        - Append blobs - appends to existing blob (like a log file)
        - Page blobs - made of pages for frequent random r/w operations
    - Blob Trigger Path - the path to the blob that is monitored for the trigger
- Common Functions Trigger Types
    - Queue - a message is added to an Azure Storage Queue
    - Azure Cosmos DB - when a document changes in a collection
    - Event Hub - when Event Hub receives a new event

## Azure Functions Input/Output Bindings
- an optional connection to data within your function
- stored in json in function.json
- Required Properties
    - Name - defines the function parameter you access the data from
    - Type - data type or service
    - Direction - input or output
    - Connection? - connection string
- Common input and output binding types
    - Blob Storage
    - Azure Service Bus Queues
    - Azure Cosmos DB
    - Azure Event Hubs
    - External Files
    - External Tables
    - HTTP Endpoints
- Reading input data - input bindings

## Azure Durable Functions
- long lasting, stateful functions
- Types:
    - Client - entry point functions, event driven written in many languages
    - Orchestrator - describe how actions are executed written in C#, JS
    - Activity - basic units of work
- Workflow Patterns:
    - Function Chaining
    - Fan out/fan in - Func1 starts multiple other functions and waits for them to complete to compute a final result.
    - Async HTTP APIs
    - Monitor - monitor something until a certain condition is met
    - Human Interaction - i.e. approval process
- Features:
    - Event driven, can perform asynchronous awaits
    - Function chaining
    - Function coordination (order in which they are performed)
    - Managed state
    - Good for custom workflows
- Orchestration Function:
    - Define code based workflows
    - Synchronous and Asynchronous function calls
    - Output from functions is saved locally and available to other functions
    - Checkpoints - functions waiting for a long time can be dehydrated, saved, and rehydrated when needed
- Function Timers
    - provide a time limit for a task to complete and an escalation step if not
    - Use in place of JS setInterval() or setTimeout() calls
    - Use currentUtcDateTime to obtain the current date and time, instead of Date.now or Date.UTC

## Azure Functions Core Tools
- A set of cmd line tools to develop and test Azure functions on your local computer.
- Used to create, modify, run, test, publish, and invoke Azure Functions
- Function App (used for portal dev)
    - Share common config values
    - Share language runtime
    - Functions configured and managed independently 
- Functions project (used for local dev)
    - Local code and config files
    - Function app equivalent
    - Code must be correctly structured and created
        - host.json - stores runtime config values used locally and on Azure
        - localsettings.json - settings used only locally
