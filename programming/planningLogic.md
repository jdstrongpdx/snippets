# Planning and Logic

## Principles
Core Components
- Servers
- Databases
- APIs

Principles
- Data Integrity & Security
- Performance Optimization
- Scalability

Error Handling & Reliability

## Project Planning
- Define requirements - What, for who, and why
- Setting objectives - SMART (see below)
- Creating timelines
- Idenfifying resources - right tools, technology and team members
- Scope - what is defined by the project and what it not

## Workflow
- Planning
- Architecture Design
- Development 
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

## SMART Goals
- Specific
- Measurable
- Achievable
- Relevant
- Time-bound
- ex. Develop and implement enhansed search functionality that reduces search time by 50% within the next six months

## Problem Solving
Logical Processes
- Sequence - the order the code is executed
- Control Structure or Conditional Statements - paths for code to follow
- Iterations - looping through a block of code
- Logical operators - boolean - AND, OR, and NOT

Deductive Reasoning
- A logical process by which conclusion are drawn from given premises
- Arguments: Premises, conclusion, supporting relation
1. Identify the premises - statements that you believe are true - should be clear, factual, and directly related to the problem you are trying to solve.
2. Analyze the premises - analyze premises to see how they relate
3. Draw a conclusion - find a direct cause-effect relationshp to identify the cause of a problem based on logic
4. Test the conclusion - test your conclusion to veryify it is correct.

```
Task: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 100 is a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.
Psuedocode:
Start
Input year 
If year is divisible by 4
  Or if year is divisible by 400
    Display to user "Leap year"
  Otherwise print “Not a leap year”
End
```

## Problem Decomposition
1. Identify the problem or goal.
2. Divide the main problem into smaller more manageable parts.
  - Top-down (general problems) - aligns with deductive reasoning 
  - Modularization (complex problems) - fragment a complex issue into smaller, independant parts that each carry out a specific role
3. Analyze and address each part individually fixing bugs or implementing components.

## Top-down Approach
- Begin with a broad overview and break it down into smaller parts.
- Use when you have a clear overview and need to break down - rigid

## Bottom-up Approach
- Begin with small managable parts and combine them to create a broad composite
- Use when you need to gather knowledge to understand the problem - exploratory, flexiable

## Algorithm Structure
- Conditional Statements
- Categorial statements - group and classify data based on criteria
- Logical structures - determine boolean conditions and comparisons

## Algorithm Design
1. Understand the problem and set a goal
2. Diagramming and outlining - create steps

## Debugging
1. Examine error message
2. Reproduce and isolate the error
3. Analyze and fix the issue

## Debugging Techniques
1. Watches - watch a variable as the program is running
2. Logging - log error message for review later
3. Print statements - quick insights into the logic flow and variables
4. Breakpoints - isolate where to pause processing

## Errors
- Logic error - when the program runs but produces incorrect results
- Syntax and runtime errors - violate languate rules or encounter errors during runtime.
