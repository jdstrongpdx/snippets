Functional Programming Paradigms
    Pure Functions	Functions that return the same output for the same input and have no side effects (do not modify external state).
    Immutability	Data is never modified after itâ€™s created. Instead, new data structures are returned with changes.
    First-class Functions	Functions are treated as values: they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.
    Higher-order Functions	Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
    Declarative Programming	Focuses on what the program should do, rather than how it does it, minimizing imperative code.
    Avoiding Side Effects	Side effects (like I/O or state mutation) are minimized or isolated to maintain predictability.
